- topic summary eng ( same in English)
- topic tags - comma separated list of words for tagging, in Russin
- topic tags eng - same list but in English
- message IDs. - comma separated list of "msg_id" values 

Please mind "reply_to_msg_id" values -it points to the message for which the current one is a reply. Thus, all messages linked by this reference, are more likely belong to one topic.
