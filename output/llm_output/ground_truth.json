According to Konstantin M, a checkup can take about an hour, including the possible queues encountered in the morning, indicating that mornings might still have some waiting time but are manageable.

Specific routes, like the 100 boulevard to Yenner line, are somewhat better, especially from west to east, but north-south routes remain problematic.

Firstly, it's helpful to contact the internet provider and inquire about the possibility of negotiating a new contract or finding another plan that better suits your needs. Additionally, as mentioned in the chat, one can consider switching to another provider. For example, when a user switched from TurkTelekom to Turkcell, Turkcell covered the penalty for terminating the previous contract early.

Comparisons are made to the USA, where being middle class is when a family can pay off a mortgage for a comfortable home within 5-10 years.",

For Russia, a middle-class family is assumed by some to need an income of around 500k to 1 million rubles per month. It is noted that the term 'middle class' is quite subjective, with different interpretations. Furthermore, being middle class might involve owning a comfortable home and having the means for regular leisure travel, such as vacations to destinations like the Maldives.

The insurance certificate for residence permits (ВНЖ) shows a yearly limit of 5000 TL."

        "answer": "Instagram might work for some users in Turkey if their device is registered as Turkish, which may bypass certain provider-level blocks.",
        "rag_answer": "Instagram might work for some users in Turkey without a VPN because of a few potential reasons. One user mentioned that their Instagram works without a VPN due to 'Turkish randomness', suggesting a possible inconsistency in the blocking process (msg_id: 184040). It's also speculated that if a phone's IMEI is configured to be recognized as Turkish, the Instagram blockage might not apply (msg_ids: 184042, 184048). Additionally, some users reported that it worked due to possibly unintentional provider-level VPN settings (msg_id: 184048). Another reason might be related to the use of Turkish SIM cards (msg_id: 184052). However, this is inconsistent as other users with similar setups still face blocks."
