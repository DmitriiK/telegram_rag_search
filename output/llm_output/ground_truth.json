        "answer": "A middle-class family is perceived differently across regions. In Russia, opinions vary from having an income starting at 500k to 1 million rubles a month. Comparisons are made to the USA, where being middle class is when a family can pay off a mortgage for a comfortable home within 5-10 years.",
        "rag_answer_gpt4o": "Defining a middle-class family varies widely based on perspectives and regions. In Russia, as of 2021, a middle-class income for a family was considered to start from 500,000 to 600,000 rubles, but this has likely increased to around a million rubles. In Europe, especially in Spain, a middle-class income is quite high and approximates a million euros, reflecting differences in cost of living and lifestyle. Moreover, the concept of middle class includes not just income but the ability to afford housing, transportation, and vacations for the family. However, there isn't a universal agreement on this classification as perceptions vary widely.",
