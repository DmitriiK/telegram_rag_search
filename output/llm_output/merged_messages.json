I‚Äôll go to another warranty center in the coming days to see what they say.\nA friend's new blender broke too; they said, under warranty, here are the details, but only we can replace them as it's under warranty, and the cost of replacement is almost equal to the cost of the blender.\n\nSuch warranties; I don't remember if it was the same in RF or not; the last time they tried to fix my chair, I didn't notice and assembled it wrong.",

When you look the sellers in the eye or at the goods, they try to lure you into the shops, and when you walk past, they shout something in Turkish, which I am sure are curses. We were forced to stay in the shop, and this person kept pressuring us, and we thought he wanted us to buy the whole store.' \n\nWhen I said I‚Äôm just looking, he stood in front of me and said: be kind, spend. For me, that was enough, and I said 'no', and he stood in front of me again and said nothing other than anger on his face. My youngest, who is 11, started crying, and then he stepped away from us, and we left. My kids tremble and fear even approaching shops and now are very cautious with Turkish men. \n\nAnother reason we won‚Äôt return is the prices for food and drinks. This is definitely extortion, and in Spain, France, and Italy, we ate much cheaper. We traveled all over the world on vacation, and Turkey is definitely the most expensive country, and you get very little return for your spending when it comes to food/drinks. In addition, water sports are very, very expensive.'\"",

I previously mentioned brands I have experienced, where at first good models were offered, but after a few years nothing close in quality is available (and prices have also increased). It started with Ecco - in the 2000s I bought lightweight, ventilated sneakers with an ideal sole and comfortable fastening. I wore them for a long time, then my father-in-law. They lasted until they were completely destroyed from around 2006 to 2021. About a year later, I tried to buy similar ones, but the entire line was worse in all characteristics.\nRecently the same thing happened with Crocs. In the year 2020 I bought their sneakers and was amazed at how comfortable they were - moderately wide, soft, suits both for heat and for moderate cold. I bought them cheap, essentially using the change from Versace and Adidas (which I bought in the same store) when I moved to Turkey. Then they updated the line, and now the sneakers have become narrow, the sole less stable, the laces now hold nothing and are just for decoration. In short, if I had known, I would have bought 5 pairs of Ecco in 2006 and 10 pairs of Crocs.",

Specialists urge citizens to be cautious when consuming food, especially outside, to avoid unwashed vegetables and fruits, and not to consume products from questionable sources.\n\nParticular attention should be paid to the duration of symptoms.

In this context, we do not use the term \"tax resident of the Russian Federation\", it is similar but different.\n\nThere are exceptions to the general prohibition:\n\n‚Äî If the transfer of money takes place between residents who live most of the calendar year outside of Russia, it is a legal currency operation.\n\nFor example, in 2023, resident A transfers money from their foreign account to resident B's foreign account. If both resident A and resident B spent more than 183 days abroad during the period from January 1 to December 31, 2023, then such a transfer is recognized as a permitted currency operation.\n\n‚Äî If the transfer of money occurs between residents who are spouses or close relatives, it is also a legal currency operation.\n\nClose relatives are parents and children; grandparents, grandchildren; brothers and sisters. In this case, it does not matter how many days such residents live in Russia or abroad.\n\nFor example, in 2023, resident A transfers money from their foreign account to resident B's foreign account. If resident A and resident B are spouses, then such a transfer is recognized as a permitted currency operation.\n\nThe fact that the account is declared does not matter. Even if the Russian tax service is unaware of the account, such a currency operation would be legal.\n\nThe fact that the account is opened in a bank of a friendly country also does not matter. Russian currency legislation regarding transfers of money between foreign accounts does not distinguish rules depending on whether the account is opened in a friendly country or not.\n\n#questions\n\n@arturdulkarnaev - channel about personal taxes",

Not a word is written about the 99 card at the cash registers of any museum (and we have already visited about 5 in Cappadocia)\n2. My wife and children have ikamets on 98, previously the muzeykart app didn't recognize them. But the cards were sold without problems. And my wife's card appeared in the app.\n3. IMPORTANT! The card says 'Digital' for a reason. The card itself has a QR code and no chip. The physical card works for only 1 day, then you need to register in the Muzekart app. By entering the ikamet number, the card will appear there.\n4. Also important. Children need to be registered too. With their mobile number, email, etc. Today we only managed to get through by the goodwill of a kind staff member at the entrance - fortunately, he understood English, we explained that the children left their phones at home and we wouldn't be able to register them at the bench at the entrance, but we came a long way specifically to their museum. As a result, we got single tickets for the children for free, but they insisted that such kind staff members might not be present in other museums.\n5. After that, entrance to museums is only through a code generated in the app. Each from their own app. Otherwise, the parent will have to log in each time to generate a code for the child. Thus, the mystery of the title 'Digital' is revealed.\nI wrote in haste, if anything - ask.",

We went to several places to return the rented modem. Some refused completely, the others asked from 2000 to 4000 lira for early termination. It seemed strange to us to pay more for contract termination than to pay the bills for the remaining months.\n\nBut then we learned a lifehack. It turns out that in Turkey you can terminate a contract with any telecommunication company completely free of charge. To do this, you need to submit a request for e-devlet to terminate the contract. Which we did. Then we took a screenshot from e-devlet with the request number and went to the office of the company‚Äôs directorate (T√ºrk Telekom M√ºd√ºrl√ºƒü√º, definitely to the directorate since small offices are ordinary private ones who \"earn\" as they can), showed them the request, they took the modem, filled out the termination form and only asked us to pay one bill for one month. And that's it.\nI hope this information will be useful to someone.\n\nLink to the application form: https://www.turkiye.gov.tr/btk-abonelik-fesih-basvurusu\nThe only thing needed for this application is additional verification. The simplest is if you have an account in a Turkish bank, you can authorize through it.\n#subscriberstory",

        "msg_text": "Recently I met a familiar Turk, and he told me a story that happened to him which made me think again and raise the topic of p2p trading in Turkish lira. The most common type of fraud that has come to Turkey is the cancellation of bank payments. Russia has long moved away from this, but the Turkish banking system suffers. Especially the makers suffer from it. I've written a lot about this, saying, drilling that being a maker in Turkish lira is dangerous. Scammers send you lira, you release Tether and then they immediately cancel the payment. Your amount gets blocked by the bank until circumstances are clarified. You go to the bank, and they just shrug and say that only the one who claimed it can remove the block. Then you find the sender, and he demands from you, \"Send me 50%, and then I'll unlock it,\" and then you can only unlock it through court, paying lawyers and spending up to a year of your life. This mainly happens on Binance Global, as Binance TR does not have a p2p section. The moral: I highly recommend not trading with the reception of lira on your cards via p2p. My acquaintance traded both as a taker and a maker. Turkey is a country with a population that is not the most educated and life-experienced. Scammers take advantage of this. More and more fraudulent schemes from Russia and Ukraine are starting to come to Turkey. More and more I‚Äôm getting private messages about requests for processing black traffic. And if cheap and free iPhones are already becoming a thing of the past, the banners \"We'll help you close your loan for 10% of the debt\" are gaining traction. The scheme is simple, like my life: a not-so-bright Turk saw such a banner on a dating site. He clicked. There‚Äôs a solution in about 10 minutes. They give a card (of my acquaintance), a victim sends lira, my acquaintance delivers Tether. Everyone seems to be happy. But the victim doesn‚Äôt get the desired. And in the best case, the victim forgets, and in the worst, goes to the police. And it seems like the situation with my acquaintance - he's a victim too, but in the Turkish legal system, things aren't that simple. And the price of the issue is only 6,000 lira. My acquaintance shows 100 pages of statements from banks where deals are done for 1 million lira, which if he were a scammer, he wouldn‚Äôt do for 6,000 lira. Luckily, he's a Turk who knows the language; I would have been immediately sent to prison for a long time. The worst thing is that in Turkish law, there's no opportunity for reconciliation. He says \"Let's compensate the victim?\" You can compensate, but the case won't be closed. The case will definitely go to court. And it turned out that he had four such cases against him!!!!! They put bracelets on him and took him to check for drugs in the hospital. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done. In the hospital, he also met someone detained on suspicion of murder, but for some reason, he was without handcuffs. My acquaintance asked, \"Why am I in handcuffs for 6,000 lira, and the murderer isn‚Äôt? The hospital formality looked like this: Doctor \"Are you healthy? Do you feel normal? Yes? Sign here. No drugs detected. Then they took him to the temporary detention facility to wait for a judge. The incident happened on Friday. The judge only came on Saturday. He looked tired and it was clear they had been celebrating well. Maybe that saved him. Or maybe it was the fact that he has small kids, has citizenship, but the escort said, \"You are the first one released; the judge is taking a risk.\" In short, they imposed a travel ban on him; he must report to the police every day and is prohibited from leaving the country. They could have marinated him in pre-trial detention for a year. Nobody knows when the trial will be. He has already given far more money to the lawyer than 6,000. Whether he will be imprisoned in the end or get a conditional release, it‚Äôs also unknown. But it certainly saved him that he is a citizen of Turkey. If he were a foreigner, he would have flown into prison for an indefinite period. That's how he traded. By the way, the investigator said, \"If it were Binance TR, everything would have been resolved quickly. But Binance Global doesn‚Äôt respond to our requests.\" But there is no p2p trading on Binance TR, and thus there wouldn't have been any problems. That's how they protect both themselves and clients. By the way, many respectable exchanges like OKEX also do not have p2p sections. The conclusion: I highly recommend not getting involved in Turkish trading on exchanges for lira on p2p.

Turkey and the EU have been negotiating on this issue since 2005. Another reason for this decision may be disagreements with other NATO members amid Turkey's close ties with Russia. \n\nFurther expansion of BRICS may be discussed during the summit in Kazan, which will take place from October 22 to 24, the agency's sources said. Agency representatives note that in the opinion of the Turkish president's administration, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, the \"geopolitical center of gravity\" is shifting from developed economies.",

If the 30-year-olds have a penchant for such entertainment, then yes, they can visit it. There‚Äôs also go-karting, but with a severely battered fleet. If the guys love go-karting, it's best to go to Park Fantastic. They have the fastest fleet I've seen in Antalya. Just as mentioned earlier, I forgot to mention that there are height restrictions. Kids won't be allowed. Plus, there are other attractions that will be interesting for younger kids if there are any. If guys over 30 are going to have fun with kids, then, in my opinion, the perfect place is Gokart Oyun behind the airport. They have an electric car fleet, everything is quiet and without stink. They also allowed even nine-year-olds to ride. There‚Äôs also a decent playground for children. The adults can enjoy chatting over a glass of tea after riding, watching the younger generation frolicking below in the playground.",

The parties could not reach an agreement, and the situation was resolved through mediation. \nAccording to Dr. Umut Metin, a representative of the Association of Mediators (TURAMEP), during the negotiations, the tenant acknowledged the fairness of the market price stated but could not afford to pay 35,000 lira. As a result, it was agreed that the tenant would continue to pay 20,000 lira as before but would agree to vacate the premises in 6 months. This is one of the common examples of solutions reached through mediation.\n\nOther examples:\nIn the second case, the tenant refused to pay rent of 12,000 lira and filed a complaint against the landlord with the prosecution, accusing him of threats and insults. However, during the negotiations, the tenant agreed to withdraw the complaint by signing an eviction agreement and continued to live in the apartment at the same rate.\nThe third case involved a conflict between neighbors due to noise. The parties came to an agreement during the mediation meeting, and the neighbor promised to install soundproofing to eliminate the problem.",

The Ministry of Finance and the Tax Administration are developing measures for mandatory rental payments through banks or postal offices (PTT). According to the project, landlords and tenants who make cash payments will be fined. The minimum fine will be 5000 lira, even if 10% of the rent amount is less than this threshold. Fines will be imposed separately on both parties for each transaction. For large entrepreneurs and representatives of free professions, the fine can reach 20,000 lira. It is expected that this draft decree will be implemented to tighten control over rental payments and prevent tax evasion. Earlier today, there was talk about introducing a penalty for making cash payments exceeding 7000 lira. Currently, the law has not yet been adopted and is in the development stage.",
